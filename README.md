# InitialCheck

This app allows to add checks to Nextcloud initialization.

# How to use it

1) Place this app in **nextcloud/apps/**;

2) Add a php file with desired check into folder `check`;

3) Enable app in Nextcloud.

There is a sample in file check_sample.php.dist, that checks if browser is Firefox* and denies user to use Nextcloud 

\* _Firefox was chosen as example only because it is free_
